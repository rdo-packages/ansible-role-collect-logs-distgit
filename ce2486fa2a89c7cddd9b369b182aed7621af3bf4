      "message": "I am afraid I cannot help with rpm spec itself as my knowledge of spec files is low.\n\nStill, I want to mention two things I problematic:\n\n- ansible content should be distributed as collections not as rpms. it is much easier, reliable and is platform independent. Only trick, we need ansible 2.9 minimal, which should not be a problem.\n\n- if we decide to still package the role as rpm, we should do it from within the upstream repository directly. We have no excuse for doing it there and assuring that it does not break without us knowing. We have full control over the repository so the need to create a distgit repo.",

      "message": "IMO, it depends how/where is going to be used. If there are plans to use this role integrated in tripleo or other tools (i heard something about sosreport?) that are being distributed as rpms it may be a good idea to package it in rpm too. Additionally, building it as rpm and distributing it as a collection from https://galaxy.ansible.com/ are compatible, you can provide both to cover different users or use cases.",
